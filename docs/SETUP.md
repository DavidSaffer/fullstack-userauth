# Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Required for running the Next.js frontend.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Required for running the Spring Boot backend.
- **Maven**: For building the Spring Boot application.
- **MySQL**: The database used by the backend.

## Installation

### Backend
1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. **Follow the [Backend Installation Guide](backend/docs/INSTALLATION.md)**.

### Frontend
1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Running the Full Stack Application
Once both the backend and frontend are set up, you can run the full stack application by following the individual setup instructions for each part. The backend will typically run on `http://localhost:8080` and the frontend on `http://localhost:3000`.
